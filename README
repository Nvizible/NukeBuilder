Nuke Plugins Builder

Instructions
------------

This project is a plugin builder for Nuke. It is based on SCons, and allows developers to use the
same SConstruct file for any system that they are building on.

The main SConstruct file shouldn't need to be modified on a case by case basis.
localSettings.py may need to be modified depending on how Nuke is installed on your system
pluginSettings.py may need to be modified if your plugin requires extra headers/libraries.

By default, it will build a node for each of the .cpp files in the source folder (as defined
in pluginSettings.py), unless there is also an equivalent .dev file (which can be empty). The
existence of the .dev file means that the node in question is still in development and shouldn't
be built as part of a standard build.


Files
-----

SConstruct        - This contains most of the core logic for building the plugin. It knows what
                    Nuke requires for each type of system that Nuke can run on. It looks at the
                    other files for anything specific to the local system.

localSettings.py  - This file contains the details of where Nuke is installed, plus the default
                    Nuke version and architecture.
                   
pluginSettings.py - This file contains any settings specific to the plugin, including where the
                    source code can be found, plus any extra libraries that may be needed to build
                    the plugins.


Usage
-----

scons [<option>=<value> [...]]


Options
-------

local        : Use a different localSettings file - the value given is appended to the module name.
               eg "local=company" would load localSettings_company.py

arch         : Compile for the specified architecture (32/64). The default value is defined in
               localSettings.py

mode         : Which mode to compile in (debug/release). Default: debug.

nodes        : Which nodes to build. This is a comma-separated list of the nodes. Default: all

dev          : If set to 1, will build nodes that are still in development. Default: 0

nuke_version : Which Nuke version to compile for. The default is defined in localSettings.py

nuke_root    : Override where to find Nuke to build against.



To Do
-----

- Add in a test stage that launches a python script in Nuke and tests to see whether the nodes
  can actually be loaded.
- Add in the ability to release plugins to another location. Have a different location depending
  on whether the mode is 'debug' or 'release'
